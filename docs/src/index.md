Provides `TensorField{B,F,N} <: GlobalFiber{LocalTensor{B,F},N}` implementation for both a local `ProductSpace` and general `ImmersedTopology` specifications on any `FrameBundle` expressed with [Grassmann.jl](https://github.com/chakravala/Grassmann.jl) algebra.
Many of these modular methods can work on input meshes or product topologies of any dimension, although there are some methods which are specialized.
Building on this, `Cartan` provides an algebra for `FiberBundle` sections and associated bundles on a manifold, such as general `Connection`, `LieDerivative`, and `CovariantDerivative` operators in terms of `Grassmann` elements.
Calculus of `Variation` fields can also be generated with the combined topology of a `FiberProductBundle`.
Furthermore, the `FiberProduct` structure enables construction of `HomotopyBundle` types.
Utility package for differential geometry and tensor calculus intended for [Adapode.jl](https://github.com/chakravala/Adapode.jl).

The `Cartan` package is intended to standardize the composition of various methods and functors applied to specialized categories transformed with a unified representation over a product topology, especially having fibers of the `Grassmann` algebra.
Initial topologies include `ProductSpace` types and in general the `ImmersedTopology`.
