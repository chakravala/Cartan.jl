Provides `TensorField{B,F,N} <: GlobalFiber{LocalTensor{B,F},N}` implementation for both a local `ProductSpace` topology and the simplicial mesh topologies imported with [Grassmann.jl](https://github.com/chakravala/Grassmann.jl).
Many of these modular methods can work on input meshes or product topologies of any dimension, although there are some methods which are specialized.
Building on this, `Cartan` provides an algebra for any `GlobalSection` and associated bundles on a manifold, such as general `Connection` and `CovariantDerivative` operators in terms of `Grassmann` elements.
Utility package for differential geometry and tensor calculus intended for packages such as [Adapode.jl](https://github.com/chakravala/Adapode.jl).

The `Cartan` package is intended to standardize the composition of various methods and functors applied to specialized categories transformed with a unified representation over a product topology, especially having fibers of the `Grassmann` algebra.
Initial topologies include `ProductSpace` types and implicitly simplicial manifolds.
```
RealRegion{V, T} where {V, T<:Real} (alias for ProductSpace{V, T, N, N, S} where {V, T<:Real, N, S<:AbstractArray{T, 1}})
Interval (alias for ProductSpace{V, T, 1, 1} where {V, T})
Rectangle (alias for ProductSpace{V, T, 2, 2} where {V, T})
Hyperrectangle (alias for ProductSpace{V, T, 3, 3} where {V, T})
```
Visualizing `TensorField` reperesentations can be standardized in combination with [Makie.jl](https://github.com/MakieOrg/Makie.jl) or [UnicodePlots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/UnicodePlots.jl).

Due to the versatility of the `TensorField` type instances, it's possible to disambiguate them into these type alias specifications with associated methods:

In the `Cartan` package, a technique is employed where an identity `TensorField` is constructed from an interval or product manifold, to generate an algebra of sections which can be used to compose parametric maps on manifolds.
Constructing a `TensorField` can be accomplished in various ways,
there are explicit techniques to construct a `TensorField` as well as implicit methods.
Additional packages such as `Adapode` build on the `TensorField` concept by generating them from differential equations.
Many of these methods can automatically generalize to higher dimensional manifolds and are compatible with discrete differential geometry.
